# CSE-450: Translation of Programming Languages
## Completed class fall semester 2022

Coding within class was made up of two components:
- **Weekly homeworks**: Simple excersizes that went along with lecture
- **Biweekly projects**: Larger projects that built off of one another. Ultimate goal to create a language called "SpartyTalk"
